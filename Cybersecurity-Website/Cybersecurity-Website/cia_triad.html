        <h1>The CIA Triad</h1>
        <p>
            This image represents a fundamental concept in cybersecurity known as the "CIA Triad." The CIA Triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The three components of the triad are Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, each of which forms a part of the triangle shown in the image.
        </p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            Confidentiality is represented by the blue part of the triangle. It means keeping sensitive information private and protected from unauthorized access. For example, your personal information on social media sites should be seen only by those you have allowed, and not by the whole world.
        </p>

        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Integrity, shown in orange, refers to maintaining the accuracy and reliability of information. This ensures that the data is not tampered with or altered by unauthorized individuals. Think of it like keeping a score in a game; you would not want someone changing the score unfairly.
        </p>

        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p>
            Availability, shown in red, is about ensuring that information is accessible to authorized users when needed. It's like being able to get your report card when you need it and not finding out that the system is down.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            These three principles are the key to any secure system. They work together to make sure that our data is safe, accurate, and available when we need it, which is especially important in a world where so much of our lives and work are online.</p>
