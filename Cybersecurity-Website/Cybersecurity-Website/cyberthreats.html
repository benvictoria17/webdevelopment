        <h1>Cyber Threats</h1>

        <h2>Malware</h2>
        <p>Malware is a type of software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device or network. Think of it as a computer virus, just like how people get sick, computers can too, with malware. It can steal, delete, or encrypt your data, hijack your computer's functions, and spy on your computer activity without you knowing.</p>
        
        <h2>Phishing</h2>
        <p>Phishing is when you get emails that try to trick you into giving out personal information like your passwords or credit card numbers. It's like a fisherman trying to lure fish; these emails lure people with fake messages that seem real. They might look like they're from a company you know or trust, but they're actually from cybercriminals.</p>
        
        <h2>Ransomware</h2>
        <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that locks you out of your computer or files and demands money to get access back. Imagine someone stealing your diary and asking for money to return it. Ransomware can block all your schoolwork or family photos until you pay up, often in untraceable Bitcoin.</p>
        
        <h2>Denial-of-Service Attacks</h2>
        <p>Denial-of-Service attacks, or DoS attacks, happen when cybercriminals overwhelm a system with so much traffic that it can't operate or respond to legitimate users. It's like a crowd of people blocking the entrance to your school so no one can get in or out. It can shut down websites, services, or networks, causing lots of problems.</p>
