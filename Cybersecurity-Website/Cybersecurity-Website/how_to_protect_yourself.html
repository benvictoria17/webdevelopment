        <h2>Understanding Cyber Threats</h2>
        <p>Cyber threats are like digital thieves and vandals. They can sneak into your devices or online accounts, steal your personal information, or even break things. Knowing about these threats is like learning the rules of the road before you start driving; it's the basic knowledge you need to navigate the internet safely.</p>
        
        <h2>Creating Strong Passwords</h2>
        <p>Strong passwords are like secret codes that only you should know. They are the first wall of defense against hackers. To make this wall sturdy, build your passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The more complex and longer it is, the harder it is for hackers to break in.</p>
        
        <h2>Avoiding Phishing Scams</h2>
        <p>Phishing scams are like those tricky questions on a test that try to fool you into the wrong answer. In the digital world, they trick you into giving away your passwords or bank info. To avoid getting tricked, look at emails and messages closely. If something looks off—like a weird email address or a link that seems suspicious—don't click!</p>
        
        <h2>Keeping Software Updated</h2>
        <p>Think of software updates as booster shots for your devices. They help your apps and operating systems stay healthy by fixing bugs and strengthening against viruses. Regular updates might seem annoying, but they're actually super important for keeping your digital devices in tip-top shape.</p>
        
        <h2>Using Antivirus Software</h2>
        <p>Antivirus software acts like a bodyguard for your computer. It stands watch, looking out for sneaky malware or viruses trying to cause trouble. By scanning your files and alerting you to threats, it helps keep your digital world safe and sound.</p>
        
        <h2>Staying Informed</h2>
        <p>Just like how fashion trends change, new cyber threats pop up all the time. Staying informed about the latest threats is like keeping up with the latest styles; it helps you know what to watch out for so you can keep your personal information safe and stylishly secure.</p>
